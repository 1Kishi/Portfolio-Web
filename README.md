# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

It showcases my projects, experience, and a deep-dive view into selected work.  
The site supports light and dark themes automatically and includes project filtering, interactive CV elements, and smooth UI transitions.

## Tech Stack

- React (mostly JavaScript, some files use .tsx and simple inline types)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
